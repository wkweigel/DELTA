# DELTA

DELTA (DNA Encoded Library Topological Assignment) is a system for classificaion of DNA encoded libraries (DELs) according to the topological arrangement of thier building blocks (BBs). <br><br>
The following repository is included as supporting information for **LINK** <br><br>
The included notebooks contain the Python scripts for the following:
  - Creation of DELs with different topologies
  - Fingerprinting and Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
  - Generative Topographic Mapping (GTM)
  - Pairwise distance calculation (Tanimoto, Euclidean, etc.)
  - Druglike property calculation
  - Principal Moment of Ineria (PMI) calculation
  - Tanimoto similarity map analysis 
  
The functions of each are discussed in more detail below.
